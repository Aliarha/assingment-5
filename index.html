    <p><b> How do you describe a sea?
            In terms of geography, seas are smaller than oceans and are usually located where the land and ocean meet.
            Typically, seas are partially enclosed by land. Seas are found on the margins of the ocean and are partially
            enclosed by land. Here, you can see that the Bering Sea is part of the Pacific Ocean.</b> </p>
    <h2> Highway</h2>
    <a href="https://www.roadtraffic-technology.com/projects/pakistan-superhighwa/">highway.com</a>
    <br>

    <p> <b> Vehicle and Traffic Law §118 defines “Highway” as “The entire width between the boundary lines of every way
            publicly maintained when any part thereof is open to the use of the public for purposes of vehicular
            travel.” which by its terms includes the right of way however measured or acquired.</b></p>
    <h2> Museum</h2>
    <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attractions-g295414-Activities-c49-Karachi_Sindh_Province.html">museum.com</a>
    <br>
    <p> <b> “A museum is a not-for-profit, permanent institution in the service of society that researches, collects,
            conserves, interprets and exhibits tangible and intangible heritage. Open to the public, accessible and
            inclusive, museums foster diversity and sustainability.</b></p>
